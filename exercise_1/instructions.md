# Instructions
- Run `npm i ` inside each folder before you do anything.

## Clean Routes
- The following code is missing essential pieces that will prevent you from having a functional express app.  Your job is to find the pieces that are missing and insert the correct syntax.
- If you have correctly fixed all the errors, you will see `Listening on port 3000` printed out in the terminal.
- You will then use POSTMAN to send an HTTP method and test the routes.  You should see all the messages sent back with their appropriate text if you have correctly fixed the routes!
